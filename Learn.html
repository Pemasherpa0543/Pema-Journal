            <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the backbone of web development. It's the standard language used
                to create and
                structure content on the web. If you've ever wondered how websites display text, images, and links, HTML
                is the answer.</p>
            <h2>Key Features of HTML</h2>

            <p> <b>1. Structure:</b> HTML provides the basic structure of a webpage. Think of it as the skeleton that
                holds
                everything in place.
                It uses various elements (or tags) to define different parts of the content.</p>
            <p> <b>2. Elements and Tags:</b> HTML uses tags like
                < h1> for headings, < p> for paragraphs, and < a> for links. These tags help browsers understand how to
                            display the content..
            </p>
            <p> <b>3. Attributes:</b> Tags can have attributes that provide additional information. For example, the
                href attribute in the < a> tag specifies
                    the URL of the link.
            </p>
            <p> <b>4. Hyperlinks:</b> One of HTML’s most powerful features is the ability to link to other web pages
                using the < a> tag. This creates a web of
                    interconnected pages, hence the term "web."</p>
            <p> <b>5. Multimedia:</b>HTML supports embedding images, videos, and other multimedia elements. Tags
                like < img> and < video> make it possible to
                        display rich media content.</p>

            <h2>Why HTML Matters</h2>
            <p>HTML is essential for anyone interested in web development. It's the foundation upon which websites are
                built, and
                understanding it is the first step toward creating your own web pages. Whether you're aiming to become a
                front-end
                developer or simply want to tweak your personal blog, learning HTML is a must.</p>

            <h2>Getting Started with HTML</h2>
            <p>Creating your first HTML document is simple. Here’s a basic example:</p>
            <img src="/images/html photo.png" width="100%">
            <p>In this example:</p>
            <p><b>* '< !DOCTYPE html>'</b> declares the document type.</p>
            <p><b>* '< html>'</b> is the root element.</p>
            <p><b>* '< head>'</b> contains meta-information about the document.</p>
            <p><b>* '< tittle>'</b> sets the title of the page.</p>
            <p><b>* '< body>'</b> holds the content that will be displayed on the page.</p>

            <p>HTML is easy to learn and incredibly powerful. As you get more familiar with it, you'll be able to create
                more complex
                and dynamic web pages. So, dive in and start building the web!</p>
            <br />

            <br />
            <p>With HTML as your starting point, you'll be well on your way to mastering web development. Happy coding!
